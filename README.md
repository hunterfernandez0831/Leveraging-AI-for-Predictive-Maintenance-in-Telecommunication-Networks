# Leveraging AI for Predictive Maintenance in Telecommunication Networks

---

## About

This project was created as part of the final capstone requirement for the Master of Science in Data Science program. With a passion for technology and a professional background in network systems, I was inspired to explore how AI could be applied to real-world telecommunications challenges. This repository showcases my ability to clean and analyze data, build predictive models, communicate findings, and address ethical considerationsâ€”skills that reflect the core outcomes of my graduate program.

## Overview

This project explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used to predict telecom equipment failures before they occur. As telecom networks become increasingly complex and critical, traditional maintenance models are no longer efficient. Predictive maintenance powered by AI offers a proactive solution, aiming to improve reliability and reduce downtime.

## Research Question

Can AI-based predictive models be used to effectively identify and prevent potential network equipment failures in telecommunication infrastructure?
