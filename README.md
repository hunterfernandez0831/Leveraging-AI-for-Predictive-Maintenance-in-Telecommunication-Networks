# Leveraging-AI-for-Predictive-Maintenance-in-Telecommunication-Networks  

This project was created as part of the final capstone requirement for the Master of Science in Data Science program. With a passion for technology and a professional background in network systems, I was inspired to explore how AI could be applied to real-world telecommunications challenges. This repository showcases my ability to clean and analyze data, build predictive models, communicate findings, and address ethical considerationsâ€”skills that reflect the core outcomes of my graduate program.
